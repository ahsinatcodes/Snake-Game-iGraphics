# Snake-Game-iGraphics

This is a simple implementation of the retro Snake Game using the C language and the iGraphics library, for my Level-1 Term-1 university project.

There are three difficulty levels: EASY (the snake can wrap around the edges of the game window), MEDIUM (the game window is surrounded by boundaries that the snake can't cross), HARD (the snake can wrap around in specific areas, there are boundary blocks at the corners and obstacles in the middle). In SETTINGS, the music can be turned on/off, the snake's body color can be changed and the data of high scores can be deleted.
